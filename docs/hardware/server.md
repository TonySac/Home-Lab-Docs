# Server

My current host system is an HP T630 Thin Client. I picked it up cheap off eBay. It's not the most powerful machine out there but seems to handle all the tasks I throw at it just fine. I've outlined some specs and changes I've made to the box here.

## Integrated Specs

Some of the notable internal specifications of this machine are:

 - AMD GX-420GI Quad Core 2.00 GHz CPU
 - AMD ATI Radeon R7E GPU
 - 3x USB 3.0 Ports (1 internal)
 - 4x USB 2.0 Ports
 - 2x DisplayPort Video Out

## Storage & Memory

The box came to me with a 32 GB M.2 SATA SSD and 8 GB RAM. There are two M.2 slots for SSDs. Unfortunately, one is limited to the 2242 form factor and they only support SATA drives. I added the following components:

 - 256 GB SATA M.2 SSD (2242 form factor)
 - 1 TB SATA M.2 SSD (2280 form factor)
 - 32 GB DDR4 RAM (2x 16 GB sticks) 

## USB Peripherals

 - Google Coral TPU
 - Nortek Z-Wave/Zigbee Stick 
 - 1 TB External 2.5" SATA HD
 - 500 GB External 2.5" SATA HD
 - Wireless Mini Keyboard/Mouse Combo

## Mods & Future

I removed the internal WiFi card since this machine is connected via ethernet. This frees up and M.2 PCI slot for me to take advantage of in the future. I also picked up some angled USB adapters to help connect devices.
