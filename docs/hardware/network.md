# Networking Hardware

My home came pre-equipped with some decent enterprise grade networking equipment. I further leveled that up with an OPNSense router. I'm also lucky enough to have a cheap, fast, and reliable fiber connection. Im paying $39/month for 100 Mbps. However, as of this writing Ookla Speedtest is reporting 488.26 down and 399.01 up from my WiFi connected laptop.

## Modem

Nothing special here. I'm using the ISP provided Calix 844e ONT/router combo. I'll get into some configuration later.

## Router

I picked up a cheap Firebat T8 dual NIC box off AliExpress to run OPNSense. It has the following notable specs:

 - Intel Celeron N5095 2.00 GHz Quad Core CPU
 - 8 GB RAM
 - 256 GB SSD HD
 - 2x Real-Tek Gigabit NICs


## Switches & APs

 - Ruckus ICX 7150-C12P PoE Switch
 - Ruckus R510 Wireless AP
 - Nicgiga 8 Port PoE Switch
