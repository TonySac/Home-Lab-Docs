# My Home Lab Documentation & Reference

Welcome to my home lab documentation site!

I built this page as a self reference document for my home lab. I've outline the hardware and software that make up my system along with some sanitized configurations. I aim to include everything from the network infrastructure and my small home server down to some of my local machines. I am by no means a computer science or network engineer. Lots of this was cobbled together from tutorials, trial & error, along with some general knowledge I picked up along the way. Changes are always being made as I learn new and better ways to do things or updates break my system.

This document will be a constant work in progress as I jump around from task to task. Portions may be incomplete. If any readers have suggestions on improving my deployments, I'm open to the suggestions.
