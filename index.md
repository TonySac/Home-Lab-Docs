# Welcome to my Home Lab Documentation!

I built this site as self reference for my Home Lab build. Its more of a home server, but Home Lab has a better ring to it. After working on things for awhile, I began to forget what, how, & why I did the things I did in my build. I figured the best way to keep track is to set up some documentation. I also thought, if I can clearly document my process, I must also have a decent understanding.

I am by no means a network or computer science engineer. A lot of what's here has been cobbled together from various internet resources, trial & error, along with some general knowledge I've picked up along the way. I've done my best to credit sources in these docs but If you stumble upon something that was uncredited, please let me know so I can add it.

The goal is to outline my hardware and some builds along with the software and configuration steps. Once again, this is my personal build and how I did things. That doesn't mean its the best way, only way, or even recommended way to set things up. If any readers have suggestions or recommendations for improvement, I'm open to ideas.

As is the nature of a "Home Lab" everything is a work in progress. I'm constantly breaking my services, making various changes, and updating these docs.
